          <h1>Elaborate on the project&rsquo;s goals in the README</h1>

<p>This application is an example of how to develop an interactive web page
using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rails</li>
<li>Rails&rsquo; Unobtrustive JavaScript</li>
<li>Turbolinks</li>
<li>StimulusJS</li>
</ul>

<p>The commit history is intentionally meticulous and verbose.</p>

<p>The intent behind this repository is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>serve as an example of real-world application built in a
server-rendered monolith</li>
<li>demonstrate how to iteratively build up a set of features over time,
starting with boring standards based HTML, then extending that
behavior with JavaScript</li>
<li>demonstrate how and when to progressively enhance a feature that works
outside of a JavaScript-capable browser environment</li>
</ul>

<p>When creating this repository, deliberate effort was exerted to strike a
balance between:</p>

<ul>
<li>explicit and verbose (HTML, model, controller) code  <em>versus</em> &ldquo;clean&rdquo;
and well-factored Rails code</li>
<li>newer, terser JavaScript syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, etc)
<em>versus</em> more familiar, approachable syntax</li>
<li>small and focussed diffs that represent the minimal amount of changes
necessary to integrate with newer libraries and concepts <em>versus</em>
real-world feature-development style commits</li>
<li>emphasizing outside-in, test-driven developed, production-ready code
<em>versus</em> emphasizing educational and approachable implementation code</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>The data model is inspired by a real-world application, but simplified
for the sake of demonstration</li>
<li>The CSS, while important and worth explaining on its own, is treated
as a peripheral implementation detail.</li>
<li>One of the original project&rsquo;s areas of focus was accessibility. For
the sake of this demonstration, most of the accessibility work
involved in the original project has been omitted</li>
<li>The number of both JavaScript and Ruby dependencies is intentionally
limited</li>
<li>The project uses Rails defaults as much as possible (i.e. MiniTest
instead of RSpec, <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html"><code>CurrentAttributes</code></a>,
<code>form_with</code> instead of <code>simple_form</code>, etc).</li>
</ul>

+
+```bash
+$ git clone git@github.com:seanpdoyle/select-your-own-seat.git
+$ cd select-your-own-seat
+$ bin/setup
+$ rails server
